|       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"   |
|       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent     |

|       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."   |
|                                                                               |

|    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of      |
|       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,        |
|       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable          |
|       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,            |
|       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the      |
|       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.                |
|                                                                               |

|       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,        |
|       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable          |

|       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,      |
|       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       |
|       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their             |
|       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)        |
|       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       |
|       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a             |
|       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work        |
|       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       |
|       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses           |
|       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate         |
|       as of the date such litigation is filed.                                |
|                                                                               |
|    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the          |
|       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without         |
|       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You          |
|       meet the following conditions:                                          |
|                                                                               |
|       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or                   |
|           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and                        |
|                                                                               |
|       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices        |
|           stating that You changed the files; and                             |
|                                                                               |
|       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works         |
|           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and          |
|           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,               |
|           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of          |
|           the Derivative Works; and                                           |
|                                                                               |
|       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its            |
|           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must    |
|           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained        |
|           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not        |
|           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one        |
|           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed      |
|           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or          |
|           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,     |
|           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and          |
|           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents     |
|           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and          |
|           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution         |
|           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside      |
|           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided        |
|           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed        |
|           as modifying the License.                                           |
|                                                                               |
|       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and      |
|       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions        |
|       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or        |
|       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,            |
|       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with      |
|       the conditions stated in this License.                                  |
|                                                                               |
|    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,     |
|       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work      |
|       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       |
|       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.               |
|       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify     |
|       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       |
|       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.                             |
|                                                                               |
|    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade     |
|       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,     |
|       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the   |
|       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.      |
|                                                                               |
|    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or            |
|       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each              |
|       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,            |
|       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or         |
|       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions    |
|       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A           |
|       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the      |
|       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any      |
|       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.  |
|                                                                               |
|    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,         |
|       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,         |
|       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       |
|       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       |
|       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,     |
|       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a      |
|       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the        |
|       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,        |
|       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all          |
|       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor           |
|       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.                    |
|                                                                               |
|    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing        |
|       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,          |
|       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       |
|       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       |
|       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       |
|       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       |
|       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,           |
|       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability            |
|       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason     |
|       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.            |
|                                                                               |
