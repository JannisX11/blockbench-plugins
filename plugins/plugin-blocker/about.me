The plugin allows you to convert a model consisting of cubic rectangles into a mold made of 1x1x1 blocks with UV mapping like minecraft blocks. The plugin helps create models for resource packs that use textures from Minecraft for models. Simply select a group of meshes or a single mesh and press the split 1x1x1 button in your tools menu.
