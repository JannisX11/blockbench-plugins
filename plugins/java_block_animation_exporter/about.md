Adds the option to turn animation keyframes into a sequence of block/item models based on the Java Block codec.
This will not export any item definition files for the exported models, so these must be referenced manually in a resource pack.
Requires Minecraft 1.21.11 or later.

Start by creating a new model or converting an existing cube-based project into a **Java Block Animation**. Create an animation. Right-click your animation. Click **Export Java Block Animation** from the drop-down menu. Each model will be displayed in-game based on settings in the Display tab.
