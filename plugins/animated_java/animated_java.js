//?? │         The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed         │
//?? │        to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,         │
//?? │         our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to         │
//?? │       share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free        │
//?? │                              software for all its users.                              │

//?? │           When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not            │
//?? │        price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you         │
//?? │        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for         │
//?? │         them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you          │
//?? │         want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new          │
//?? │               free programs, and that you know you can do these things.               │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights          │
//?? │          with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer          │
//?? │         you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute         │
//?? │                              and/or modify the software.                              │

//?? │              A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that              │
//?? │            improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they            │
//?? │           receive widespread use, become available for other developers to            │
//?? │           incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and            │
//?? │           encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of           │
//?? │         software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.         │
//?? │         The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and          │
//?? │          letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its          │
//?? │                              source code to the public.                               │

//?? │           The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to           │
//?? │        ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available         │
//?? │          to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to           │
//?? │         provide the source code of the modified version running there to the          │
//?? │        users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on         │
//?? │          a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source          │
//?? │                             code of the modified version.                             │

//?? │         a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has          │
//?? │       released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under        │

//?? │           a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.           │

//?? │          to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible          │

//?? │         The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other          │
//?? │         than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of          │
//?? │           packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major            │
//?? │          Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that           │
//?? │          Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an           │
//?? │           implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A           │
//?? │         "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component         │
//?? │          (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system          │
//?? │           (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to           │
//?? │            produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.            │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all          │
//?? │          the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable          │
//?? │        work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to         │
//?? │          control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's           │
//?? │        System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free         │
//?? │         programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but         │
//?? │          which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source           │
//?? │         includes interface definition files associated with source files for          │
//?? │          the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically           │
//?? │         linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,         │
//?? │         such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those          │
//?? │                       subprograms and other parts of the work.                        │

//?? │                                        Source.                                        │

//?? │          You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you           │
//?? │            receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and             │
//?? │          appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;          │

//?? │        non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;         │
//?? │         keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all          │
//?? │               recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.               │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,          │

//?? │          You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to          │
//?? │           produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the           │
//?? │       terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:        │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified           │
//?? │                            it, and giving a relevant date.                            │

//?? │              b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is              │
//?? │          released under this License and any conditions added under section           │
//?? │             7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to             │
//?? │                              "keep intact all notices".                               │

//?? │              c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this              │
//?? │             License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This              │
//?? │           License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7           │
//?? │            additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,             │
//?? │              regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no              │
//?? │           permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not            │
//?? │            invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.             │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │           d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display           │
//?? │          Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive           │
//?? │            interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your             │
//?? │                            work need not make them do so.                             │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent          │
//?? │         works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,          │
//?? │         and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,          │
//?? │          in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an          │
//?? │          "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not           │
//?? │          used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users          │
//?? │         beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work         │
//?? │           in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other           │
//?? │                                parts of the aggregate.                                │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │                            6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.                             │

//?? │           You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms           │
//?? │                of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the                 │
//?? │        machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,         │
//?? │                                 in one of these ways:                                 │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │           a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product            │
//?? │            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the             │
//?? │                Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium                │
//?? │                      customarily used for software interchange.                       │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │           b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product            │
//?? │             (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a              │
//?? │            written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as             │
//?? │          long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product           │
//?? │           model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a            │
//?? │             copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the              │
//?? │            product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical             │
//?? │           medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no            │
//?? │             more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this              │
//?? │                    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the                     │
//?? │               Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.                │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │           c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the           │
//?? │               written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This                │
//?? │           alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and           │
//?? │          only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord           │
//?? │                                  with subsection 6b.                                  │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │            d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated             │
//?? │          place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the           │
//?? │           Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no           │
//?? │             further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the              │
//?? │           Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to           │
//?? │          copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source           │
//?? │            may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)            │
//?? │          that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain           │
//?? │           clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the           │
//?? │              Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the               │
//?? │            Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is            │
//?? │            available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.             │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided          │
//?? │            you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding             │
//?? │           Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no            │
//?? │                              charge under subsection 6d.                              │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │         A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded         │
//?? │            from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be             │
//?? │                      included in conveying the object code work.                      │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │         A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any          │
//?? │        tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,        │
//?? │       or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation       │
//?? │       into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,       │
//?? │       doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular        │
//?? │          product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a           │
//?? │       typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status        │
//?? │           of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user           │
//?? │       actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product        │
//?? │        is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial        │
//?? │        commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent        │
//?? │                   the only significant mode of use of the product.                    │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │           "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,            │
//?? │       procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install        │
//?? │       and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from       │
//?? │         a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must         │
//?? │        suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object        │
//?? │            code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because             │
//?? │                              modification has been made.                              │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │         If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or          │
//?? │         specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as          │
//?? │         part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the         │
//?? │          User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a          │
//?? │         fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the          │
//?? │         Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied          │
//?? │         by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply         │
//?? │           if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install           │
//?? │          modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has          │
//?? │                                been installed in ROM).                                │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │        The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a         │
//?? │       requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates        │
//?? │        for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for        │
//?? │       the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a       │
//?? │           network may be denied when the modification itself materially and           │
//?? │       adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and        │
//?? │                    protocols for communication across the network.                    │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │         Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,         │
//?? │           in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly            │
//?? │           documented (and with an implementation available to the public in           │
//?? │          source code form), and must require no special password or key for           │
//?? │                            unpacking, reading or copying.                             │

//?? │                                 7. Additional Terms.                                  │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │         "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this          │
//?? │           License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.            │
//?? │        Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall         │
//?? │        be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent         │
//?? │         that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions          │
//?? │          apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately          │
//?? │          under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by          │
//?? │              this License without regard to the additional permissions.               │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │           When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option            │
//?? │         remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of         │
//?? │           it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own            │
//?? │          removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place           │
//?? │          additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,          │
//?? │           for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.            │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │         Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you         │
//?? │       add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of       │
//?? │            that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:            │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the           │
//?? │                    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or                    │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or           │
//?? │           author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal            │
//?? │                     Notices displayed by works containing it; or                      │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or          │
//?? │            requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in             │
//?? │              reasonable ways as different from the original version; or               │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or          │
//?? │                              authors of the material; or                              │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │           e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some            │
//?? │                     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or                     │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │             f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that             │
//?? │         material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of          │
//?? │          it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for          │
//?? │          any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on          │
//?? │                             those licensors and authors.                              │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │           All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further           │
//?? │        restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you         │
//?? │         received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is          │
//?? │             governed by this License along with a term that is a further              │
//?? │        restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains         │
//?? │         a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this         │
//?? │         License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms         │
//?? │         of that license document, provided that the further restriction does          │
//?? │                      not survive such relicensing or conveying.                       │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you          │
//?? │             must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the              │
//?? │          additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating           │
//?? │                          where to find the applicable terms.                          │

//?? │         Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the          │
//?? │            form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;             │
//?? │                       the above requirements apply either way.                        │

//?? │          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly           │
//?? │          provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or          │
//?? │         modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under         │
//?? │          this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third          │
//?? │                               paragraph of section 11).                               │

//?? │         holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means          │
//?? │                         prior to 60 days after the cessation.                         │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │             Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is              │
//?? │          reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the           │
//?? │          violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have          │
//?? │         received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that         │
//?? │          copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after          │
//?? │                              your receipt of the notice.                              │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │         Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the          │
//?? │         licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under         │
//?? │        this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently         │
//?? │          reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same          │
//?? │                              material under section 10.                               │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │                     9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.                     │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or           │
//?? │          run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work          │
//?? │         occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission          │
//?? │           to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,           │
//?? │         nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or         │
//?? │         modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do          │
//?? │          not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a           │
//?? │         covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.          │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │                   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.                   │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │           Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically            │
//?? │          receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and           │
//?? │        propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible         │
//?? │             for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.              │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an          │
//?? │          organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an          │
//?? │         organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered          │
//?? │              work results from an entity transaction, each party to that              │
//?? │          transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever           │
//?? │         licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could         │
//?? │         give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the          │
//?? │         Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if         │
//?? │             the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.             │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the           │
//?? │         rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may          │
//?? │          not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of           │
//?? │        rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation         │
//?? │         (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that          │
//?? │         any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for         │
//?? │                 sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.                  │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │                                     11. Patents.                                      │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this          │
//?? │         License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The          │
//?? │         work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".         │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │            A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims            │
//?? │          owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or          │
//?? │         hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted         │
//?? │        by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,         │
//?? │              but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a              │
//?? │         consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For          │
//?? │          purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant           │
//?? │          patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of           │
//?? │                                     this License.                                     │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │         Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free          │
//?? │          patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to           │
//?? │         make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and         │
//?? │                  propagate the contents of its contributor version.                   │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │         In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express          │
//?? │         agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent         │
//?? │        (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to         │
//?? │         sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a          │
//?? │         party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a          │
//?? │                               patent against the party.                               │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │         If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,          │
//?? │         and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone          │
//?? │        to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a         │
//?? │         publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,          │
//?? │           then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so            │
//?? │          available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the          │
//?? │         patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner          │
//?? │        consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent         │
//?? │         license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have         │
//?? │         actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the         │
//?? │        covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work         │
//?? │         in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that         │
//?? │                  country that you have reason to believe are valid.                   │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │             If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or             │
//?? │          arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a          │
//?? │            covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties            │
//?? │         receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify         │
//?? │        or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license         │
//?? │         you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered          │
//?? │                              work and works based on it.                              │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within           │
//?? │              the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is              │
//?? │         conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are         │
//?? │        specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered         │
//?? │         work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is          │
//?? │        in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment         │
//?? │         to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying          │
//?? │            the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the            │
//?? │         parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory         │
//?? │           patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work            │
//?? │         conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily          │
//?? │           for and in connection with specific products or compilations that           │
//?? │          contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,          │
//?? │              or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.              │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │          Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting          │
//?? │            any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may             │
//?? │              otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.               │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │                         12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.                          │
//?? │                                                                                       │
//?? │        If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or         │
//?? │        otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not         │
//?? │        excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a        │
//?? │       covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this        │
//?? │      License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may       │
//?? │      not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you      │
//?? │       to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey        │
//?? │         the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this         │
//?? │           License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.            │
//?? │                                                                                       │

//?? │        Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the         │
//?? │            Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users            │
//?? │       interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version        │
//?? │        supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding         │
//?? │        Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source         │
//?? │        from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary         │
//?? │         means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source         │
//?? │       shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3        │
//?? │        of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the         │
//?? │                                 following paragraph.                                  │

//?? │             Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have             │
//?? │          permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed          │
//?? │            under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single            │
//?? │          combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this          │
//?? │         License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,         │
//?? │        but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version         │
//?? │                         3 of the GNU General Public License.                          │

//?? │        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of        │

//?? │     will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to     │
//?? │                           address new problems or concerns.                           │

//?? │            Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the             │
//?? │      Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General      │
//?? │           Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the           │
//?? │         option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered          │
//?? │            version or of any later version published by the Free Software             │
//?? │         Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the          │
