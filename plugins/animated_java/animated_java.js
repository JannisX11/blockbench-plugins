//?? │      The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for      │
//?? │       software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure        │

//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │      The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed      │
//?? │     to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,      │
//?? │      our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to      │
//?? │    share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free     │
//?? │                           software for all its users.                           │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │        When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not         │
//?? │     price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you      │
//?? │     have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for      │
//?? │      them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you       │
//?? │      want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new       │
//?? │            free programs, and that you know you can do these things.            │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights       │
//?? │       with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer       │
//?? │      you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute      │
//?? │                           and/or modify the software.                           │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │           A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that           │
//?? │         improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they         │
//?? │        receive widespread use, become available for other developers to         │
//?? │        incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and         │
//?? │        encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of        │
//?? │      software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.      │
//?? │      The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and       │
//?? │       letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its       │
//?? │                           source code to the public.                            │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │        The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to        │
//?? │     ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available      │
//?? │       to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to        │
//?? │      provide the source code of the modified version running there to the       │
//?? │     users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on      │
//?? │       a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source       │
//?? │                          code of the modified version.                          │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │         An older license, called the Affero General Public License and          │
//?? │     published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is     │
//?? │      a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has       │
//?? │    released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under     │
//?? │                                  this license.                                  │

//?? │        To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without         │
//?? │          permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for          │
//?? │      infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a      │
//?? │      computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,       │
//?? │      distribution (with or without modification), making available to the       │
//?? │             public, and in some countries other activities as well.             │

//?? │       To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other       │

//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │      A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official       │
//?? │       standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of       │
//?? │      interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that       │
//?? │            is widely used among developers working in that language.            │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │      The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other       │
//?? │      than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of       │
//?? │        packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major         │
//?? │       Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that        │
//?? │       Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an        │
//?? │        implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A        │
//?? │      "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component      │
//?? │       (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system       │
//?? │        (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to        │
//?? │         produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.         │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all       │
//?? │       the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable       │
//?? │     work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to      │
//?? │       control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's        │
//?? │     System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free      │
//?? │      programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but      │
//?? │       which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source        │
//?? │      includes interface definition files associated with source files for       │
//?? │       the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically        │
//?? │      linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,      │
//?? │      such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those       │
//?? │                    subprograms and other parts of the work.                     │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │          The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users          │
//?? │       can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding        │
//?? │                                     Source.                                     │

//?? │         The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that         │
//?? │                                   same work.                                    │

//?? │        All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of        │
//?? │        copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated        │
//?? │       conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited       │
//?? │      permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a       │
//?? │      covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its      │
//?? │      content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your       │

//?? │          You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not          │
//?? │      convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains       │
//?? │     in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose      │
//?? │      of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you      │
//?? │     with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with      │
//?? │      the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do       │
//?? │     not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works      │

//?? │       and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of        │
//?? │         your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.          │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │        Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under        │

//?? │                              makes it unnecessary.                              │

//?? │       No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological        │
//?? │      measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article      │
//?? │         11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or         │
//?? │          similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such          │
//?? │                                    measures.                                    │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid       │
//?? │    circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention     │
//?? │       is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to       │
//?? │     the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or      │
//?? │      modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's       │
//?? │      users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of      │
//?? │                             technological measures.                             │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │                          4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.                          │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you        │
//?? │         receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and          │
//?? │       appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;       │
//?? │            keep intact all notices stating that this License and any            │
//?? │     non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;      │
//?? │      keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all       │
//?? │            recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.            │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,       │
//?? │           and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.           │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │                     5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.                      │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to       │
//?? │        produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the        │
//?? │    terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:     │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified        │
//?? │                         it, and giving a relevant date.                         │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │           b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is           │
//?? │       released under this License and any conditions added under section        │
//?? │          7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to          │
//?? │                           "keep intact all notices".                            │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │           c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this           │
//?? │          License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This           │
//?? │        License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7        │
//?? │         additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,          │
//?? │           regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no           │
//?? │        permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not         │
//?? │         invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.          │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │        d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display        │
//?? │       Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive        │
//?? │         interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your          │
//?? │                         work need not make them do so.                          │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent       │
//?? │      works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,       │
//?? │      and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,       │
//?? │       in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an       │
//?? │       "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not        │
//?? │       used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users       │
//?? │      beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work      │
//?? │        in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other        │
//?? │                             parts of the aggregate.                             │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │                         6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.                          │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │        You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms        │
//?? │             of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the              │
//?? │     machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,      │
//?? │                              in one of these ways:                              │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │        a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product         │
//?? │         (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the          │
//?? │             Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium             │
//?? │                   customarily used for software interchange.                    │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │        b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product         │
//?? │          (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a           │
//?? │         written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as          │
//?? │       long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product        │
//?? │        model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a         │
//?? │          copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the           │
//?? │         product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical          │
//?? │        medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no         │
//?? │          more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this           │
//?? │                 conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the                  │
//?? │            Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.             │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │        c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the        │
//?? │            written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This             │
//?? │        alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and        │
//?? │       only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord        │
//?? │                               with subsection 6b.                               │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │         d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated          │
//?? │       place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the        │
//?? │        Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no        │
//?? │          further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the           │
//?? │        Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to        │
//?? │       copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source        │
//?? │         may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)         │
//?? │       that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain        │
//?? │        clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the        │
//?? │           Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the            │
//?? │         Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is         │
//?? │         available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.          │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided       │
//?? │         you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding          │
//?? │        Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no         │
//?? │                           charge under subsection 6d.                           │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │      A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded      │
//?? │         from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be          │
//?? │                   included in conveying the object code work.                   │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │      A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any       │
//?? │     tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,     │
//?? │    or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation    │
//?? │    into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,    │
//?? │    doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular     │
//?? │       product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a        │
//?? │    typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status     │
//?? │        of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user        │
//?? │    actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product     │
//?? │     is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial     │
//?? │     commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent     │
//?? │                the only significant mode of use of the product.                 │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │        "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,         │
//?? │    procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install     │
//?? │    and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from    │
//?? │      a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must      │
//?? │     suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object     │
//?? │         code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because          │
//?? │                           modification has been made.                           │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │      If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or       │
//?? │      specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as       │
//?? │      part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the      │
//?? │       User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a       │
//?? │      fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the       │
//?? │      Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied       │
//?? │      by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply      │
//?? │        if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install        │
//?? │       modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has       │
//?? │                             been installed in ROM).                             │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │     The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a      │
//?? │    requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates     │
//?? │     for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for     │
//?? │    the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a    │
//?? │        network may be denied when the modification itself materially and        │
//?? │    adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and     │
//?? │                 protocols for communication across the network.                 │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │      Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,      │
//?? │        in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly         │
//?? │        documented (and with an implementation available to the public in        │
//?? │       source code form), and must require no special password or key for        │
//?? │                         unpacking, reading or copying.                          │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │                              7. Additional Terms.                               │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │      "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this       │
//?? │        License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.         │
//?? │     Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall      │
//?? │     be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent      │
//?? │      that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions       │
//?? │       apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately       │
//?? │       under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by       │
//?? │           this License without regard to the additional permissions.            │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │        When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option         │
//?? │      remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of      │
//?? │        it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own         │
//?? │       removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place        │
//?? │       additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,       │
//?? │        for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.         │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you      │
//?? │    add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of    │
//?? │         that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:         │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the        │
//?? │                 terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or                 │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or        │
//?? │        author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal         │
//?? │                  Notices displayed by works containing it; or                   │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or       │
//?? │         requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in          │
//?? │           reasonable ways as different from the original version; or            │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or       │
//?? │                           authors of the material; or                           │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │        e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some         │
//?? │                  trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or                  │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │          f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that          │
//?? │      material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of       │
//?? │       it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for       │
//?? │       any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on       │
//?? │                          those licensors and authors.                           │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │        All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further        │
//?? │     restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you      │
//?? │      received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is       │
//?? │          governed by this License along with a term that is a further           │
//?? │     restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains      │
//?? │      a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this      │
//?? │      License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms      │
//?? │      of that license document, provided that the further restriction does       │
//?? │                   not survive such relicensing or conveying.                    │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you       │
//?? │          must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the           │
//?? │       additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating        │
//?? │                       where to find the applicable terms.                       │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │      Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the       │
//?? │         form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;          │
//?? │                    the above requirements apply either way.                     │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │                                 8. Termination.                                 │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly        │
//?? │       provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or       │
//?? │      modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under      │
//?? │       this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third       │
//?? │                            paragraph of section 11).                            │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │         However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your          │
//?? │          license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)           │
//?? │       provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and       │
//?? │     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright      │
//?? │      holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means       │
//?? │                      prior to 60 days after the cessation.                      │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │          Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is           │
//?? │       reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the        │
//?? │       violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have       │
//?? │      received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that      │
//?? │       copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after       │
//?? │                           your receipt of the notice.                           │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │      Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the       │
//?? │      licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under      │
//?? │     this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently      │
//?? │       reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same       │
//?? │                           material under section 10.                            │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │                  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.                  │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or        │
//?? │       run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work       │
//?? │      occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission       │
//?? │        to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,        │
//?? │      nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or      │
//?? │      modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do       │
//?? │       not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a        │
//?? │      covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.       │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │                10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.                │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │        Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically         │
//?? │       receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and        │
//?? │     propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible      │
//?? │          for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.           │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an       │
//?? │       organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an       │
//?? │      organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered       │
//?? │           work results from an entity transaction, each party to that           │
//?? │       transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever        │
//?? │      licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could      │
//?? │      give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the       │
//?? │      Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if      │
//?? │          the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.          │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the        │
//?? │      rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may       │
//?? │       not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of        │
//?? │     rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation      │
//?? │      (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that       │
//?? │      any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for      │
//?? │              sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.               │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │                                  11. Patents.                                   │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this       │
//?? │      License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The       │
//?? │      work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".      │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │         A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims         │
//?? │       owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or       │

//?? │     (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to      │
//?? │      sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a       │
//?? │      party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a       │
//?? │                            patent against the party.                            │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │      If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,       │
//?? │      and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone       │
//?? │     to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a      │
//?? │      publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,       │
//?? │        then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so         │
//?? │       available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the       │
//?? │      patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner       │
//?? │     consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent      │
//?? │      license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have      │
//?? │      actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the      │
//?? │     covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work      │
//?? │      in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that      │
//?? │               country that you have reason to believe are valid.                │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │          If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or          │
//?? │       arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a       │
//?? │         covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties         │
//?? │      receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify      │
//?? │     or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license      │
//?? │      you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered       │
//?? │                           work and works based on it.                           │

//?? │       A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within        │
//?? │           the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is           │
//?? │      conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are      │
//?? │     specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered      │
//?? │      work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is       │
//?? │     in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment      │
//?? │      to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying       │
//?? │         the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the         │
//?? │      parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory      │
//?? │        patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work         │
//?? │      conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily       │
//?? │        for and in connection with specific products or compilations that        │
//?? │       contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,       │
//?? │           or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.           │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │       Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting       │
//?? │         any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may          │
//?? │           otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.            │
//?? │                                                                                 │

//?? │     If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or      │
//?? │     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not      │
//?? │     excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a     │
//?? │    covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this     │
//?? │   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may    │
//?? │   not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you   │
//?? │    to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey     │
//?? │      the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this      │
//?? │        License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.         │

//?? │     Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the      │

//?? │    interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version     │
//?? │     supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding      │
//?? │     Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source      │
//?? │     from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary      │
//?? │      means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source      │

//?? │         under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single         │

//?? │     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of     │

//?? │         Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the          │
//?? │   Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General   │
//?? │        Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the        │
//?? │      option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered       │
//?? │         version or of any later version published by the Free Software          │
//?? │      Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the       │
//?? │  GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published   │

//?? │          If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future          │
//?? │   versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's   │
//?? │     public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you      │
//?? │                     to choose that version for the Program.                     │
//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │           Later license versions may give you additional or different           │
//?? │       permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any       │
//?? │       author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a       │
//?? │                                 later version.                                  │

//?? │                                                                                 │
//?? │        THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY         │

//?? │       If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest       │
//?? │     possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it      │

//?? │      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest       │
//?? │       to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively       │

# Animated Java does not work in Blockbench 5

You will need to install and use Blockbench v4.12.6 to use Animated Java until it is updated to support 5.

## How to install Blockbench v4.12.6

1. Download the portable version of Blockbench 4.12.6 [here](https://github.com/JannisX11/blockbench/releases/download/v4.12.6/Blockbench_4.12.6_portable.exe).
2. Once it's finished downloading, double click the .exe file to run it.

If you're familiar with command line interfaces, you can use [Envbench](https://www.npmjs.com/package/envbench) to install and manage multiple Blockbench versions side by side.
