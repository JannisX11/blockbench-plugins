<span style="color:#ba372a"><strong>This plugin is intended to be used with the <em>Hytale Bridge</em> Blockbench plugin installed. You cannot connect to Blockbench without it.</strong></span>

Blockbench Bridge allows to edit Hytale's Common assets (`.blockymodel` & `.png` files specifically) without leaving Blockbench, even on remote servers!

You can connect a Blockbench client to the server by running `/blockbench` in the console or as a player with the correct permissions. You will receive an authorisation key which you can input alongside the server's connection address (with the Blockbench-specific port) to form a bridge and sync all files!

### Usage
1. Go to the Hytale File Browser Panel > click on Connect to Hytale
2. Input the server address (with the custom Blockbench port the server uses) and the key provided by Hytale to connect.
3. Left/Right click folders and files to interact
4. Request files at any time by going to Files > Request Hytale Files
