<span style="color:#ba372a"><strong>This plugin is intended to be used with the <em>Blockbench Bridge</em> Hytale plugin installed. You cannot connect to Hytale without it. You can install it [here on CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/bbb).</strong></span>

Hytale Bridge allows to edit Hytale's Common assets (`.blockymodel` & `.png` files specifically) without leaving Blockbench, even on remote servers!

You can connect to Hytale by running `/blockbench` in the console or as a player with the correct permissions in your server. You will receive an authorisation key which you can input alongside the server's connection address to form a bridge and sync all files!

Once connected, you'll see all of the asset packs installed on your world, including all of their Common files. You're then free to open any model/texture into blockbench or save any of your creations into your own asset packs. Folder creation/management is also supported, so just Blockbench can manage your entire Common directory!

<sup>Note this plugin is still in beta and some minor bugs are to be expected. I have many more ideas on how to further improve this project, and I'd love to hear all of your thoughts and feedback.</sup>

2. Input the server address and the key provided by Hytale to connect.
3. Left/Right click folders and files to interact
