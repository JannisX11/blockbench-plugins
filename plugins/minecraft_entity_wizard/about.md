This Entity Wizard for Minecraft Bedrock Edition let's you add your own custom entity to the game without any prior coding knowledge.

Select from a list of presets, and customize basic properties of the entity.

Then you can use Blockbench's powerful editor to design your own model for the entity!

The generated Add-On can be added to Minecraft, and you can summon your custom entity into your own world!

> Developed by the creator of Blockbench, in collaboration with Mojang Studios!
