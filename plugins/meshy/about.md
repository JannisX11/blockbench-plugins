# Meshy
Meshy is a plugin for Blockbench that allows you to create meshes from your bedrock models and import them into Minecraft. 

It's pretty simple just download the plugin and make a mesh like you normally would. Then add the geometry to your project.
Alternatively you can also import an obj file then export it as a mesh. File -> Import -> Import OBJ File.

It may also be slower for large meshes or if you don't have a the best computer. I've tested it quite large meshes and it works fine. But millage may vary.
## Settings

### Normalize UVs 
This will normalize the UVs of the mesh so that they are all between 0 and 1. This on by default it works either way but it is recommended to turn it on. So that if you change the texture size it will still be proprietary sized.

### Skip Normals
This is a feature that skips the normal calculation for the mesh. This is off by default becuase most of the time you want to have the shading information. It will result in a smaller file size and will be faster to export. ( Not a major diffrence but it is a diffrence )

### Force Multi-Textures
This forces multiple textures to be used for bedrock models. This is off by default sense bedrock models can only have one texture. This force them to be enabled. But you will need to stitch the textures before you try puttinng them in minecraft. The plugin Texture Stitcher by mchorse can do this for you.
