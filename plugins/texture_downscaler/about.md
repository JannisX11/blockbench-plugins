Downscales your textures to a lower resolution **non-destructively**. Use your high-resolution source textures, while previewing and exporting them as their downscaled low-resolution counterparts.

Right-click a texture and choose `Downscale Texture...`, then choose your target resolution and downsampling method.

Only glTF export will use the downscaled texture. OBJ and FBX export will use the original high-resolution version.
