# Bone View Plugin for Blockbench

![Bone View Icon](icon.png)

The Bone View plugin provides an essential toolset for animators and riggers working in Blockbench. It adds a toggleable "Bone View" mode that visualizes your model's armature, making it easier to understand and debug complex rigs.

## Features

-   **Clear Armature Visualization**: Toggling Bone View makes your model's geometry semi-transparent and displays the underlying bone structure.
-   **Bone and Pivot Representation**: Each group is represented by a bone and an axis helper, clearly marking its pivot point and orientation.
-   **Customizable Hotkey**: Quickly toggle the view with a hotkey (default: `Shift+B`), which can be customized in the settings.
-   **Seamless Integration**: The plugin adds a "Toggle Bone View" button to the "View" menu for easy access.
