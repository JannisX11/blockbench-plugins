# About Bone View

The Bone View plugin is designed to simplify the process of rigging and animating in Blockbench by providing a clear, visual representation of the model's armature.

### How it Works

When Bone View is enabled, the plugin:
1.  Makes all the model's geometry semi-transparent.
2.  Draws a "bone" for each group, originating from its pivot point.
3.  Orients the bone to point towards the first child group, clearly indicating the hierarchical relationship.
4.  Places an axis helper at each group's pivot point, showing its orientation in 3D space.

This allows you to see the exact pivot points and connections of your model's rig without the model's geometry obscuring your view, making it an indispensable tool for debugging and fine-tuning animations.
