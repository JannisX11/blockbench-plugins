Adds sliders and other tools to modify keyframes:

You can add the sliders and tools to any of your toolbars by clicking the three dots on the right side and selecting **Customize**. Search for the slider you want to add and click to add it.

- **Tween Keyframes:** Amplify the values of the selected keyframes
- **Amplify Keyframes:** Amplify the values of the selected keyframes
- **Ease Keyframes:** Create a curve with the selected keyframes between the adjacent keyframes
- **Retime Keyframes:** Shift the curve in the graph editor without changing the time of the keyframe. This allows you to change the time of one axis individually
- **Ground Speed:** For molang-driven walk animations. Use the slider to sync the animation with the ground below it. This will insert the modified_distance_moved query into the anim time update field.
- **Keyframe Slider Axis:** Select which axis the keyframe sliders affect
- **Normalize Keyframes:** Subtract the currently displayed value from all selected keyframes, in order to remove the base pose from the model.
