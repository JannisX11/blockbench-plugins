Adds the options to import a glTF (.GLTF or .GLB) model as a generic model.
Currently only imports meshes, textures and groups.
Armatures and animations are not supported as of this version.

<!-- // TODO: - Blockbench 5.0 or newer is required to import armatures. -->
<!-- // TODO: - The "Cameras" plugin *(by JannisX11)* is required to import cameras. -->
