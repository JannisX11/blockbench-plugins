The armor stand for an animation can be summoned with \"/function animation_pack:create\". Supports looping, time scale, block/blockbench unit scale, pausing and playback, and start delays.",

Find your installation, click the triple dot, and slect **Edit**.\n3. Select **More Options**.\n4. Inside the **JVM ARGUMENTS** field, add:\n`-Dplayer.models.local=true -Dplayer.models.reload=true`\nNote:\t**player.models.reload** reloads the model every 5 seconds in game, and can be disabled after you finish making the model.\n5. Make a folder named <code>playermodels</code> inside your **.minecraft** folder.\n6. Inside that folder, make 2 more folders named <code>items</code> and <code>users</code>.\n\n## Usage\n- You need a config file for every player with a player model. This config file must be the players username, and needs to go in the **users** folder.\n**Example**: `.minecraft/playermodels/users/ewanhowell5195.cfg`\n- You can create a user config by going to **File > Export > Create OptiFine Player Model Config**.\n- Exported player models should go in a folder named what the player model is, inside the **items** folder, and be named `model.cfg`.\n**Example**: `.minecraft/playermodels/items/horns/model.cfg`\n- If not using **Use Player Texture**, textures must go inside a folder named `users` located next to the model file, and be named the players username.\n**Example**: `.minecraft/playermodels/items/horns/users/ewanhowell5195.png`\n\n## Limitations\n- They are client side only.\n- They are not part of resource packs.\n- They require OptiFine, and JVM args set in the launcher.\n- Animations are not supported.\n- You can only target specific players, not all players.\n\n## Important\nEnabling the player model JVM arguments **will disable any online player models**, usually being seasonal cosmetics like the Santa and Witch hats.",

		"about": "Have you ever been using BoxUV and had to change to Per-Face UV because your cubes were smaller than one unit on an axis? You can use the BoxUV Cube Flagger plugin to flash all possible invalid cubes in your project. This includes cubes with decimal sizes and cubes less than 1, both of which can cause complications and errors. Simple, yet effective.\n\n## How to use\nTo use this plugin, go to `File > Plugins > Available` and search for `BoxUV Cube Flagger`. Click install, then use `Tools > Flag Cubes` and click one of the options. Clicking the first option causes the plugin to flag cubes less than 1. The second option allows Blockbench to flag cubes with decimal sizes.\n\n\nIt would be appreciated to report any bugs and suggestions!"
